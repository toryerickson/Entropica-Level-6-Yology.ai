## Reporting a Vulnerability

The EFM Codex is a technical specification, not executable code. However, we take specification-level security seriously.

### What to Report

- Logical flaws in safety properties (P1–P8)
- Gaps in the Constitutional Kernel that could allow bypass
- Weaknesses in ZK-SP proof specifications
- Adversarial scenarios not covered by testing

### How to Report

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email: security@entropica.ai

Include:
- Document and section affected
- Description of the vulnerability
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Plan**: Within 2 weeks
- **Publication**: Coordinated disclosure

### Recognition

We maintain a security acknowledgments page for responsible disclosures.
